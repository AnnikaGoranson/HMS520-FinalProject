We have chosen to analyze a data set. Our overall goal is to examine EPA toxic release inventory data on toxic chemicals in 2021. 
Over the next week, we will look at the types of classifications of each chemical and estimates of total quantity released in each report. We will see if there is any differentiation by state in these values. We hope to produce a map of chemical releases and various helpful visulizations to display the results of our analysis.
